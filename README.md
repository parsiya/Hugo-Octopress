## Quick start
Add the theme to your existing site or [Hugo's quick start][hugo-quickstart].
All commands are run from the root directory of your website.

[hugo-quickstart]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

If using git to manage your website, add the theme as a git submodule:

```
git clone https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress themes/Hugo-Octopress
```

Or you can clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress themes/Hugo-Octopress
```

To view the theme with the example site:

```
cd themes/Hugo-Octopress/exampleSite
hugo serve -vw
```

And view the example website at http://localhost:1313.

Example site was originally created by
[https://github.com/nonumeros][nonumeros]. I reviewed the
[pull request][examplesite-pr] almost two years late and had to copy/paste the
website instead of resolving merge conflicts. The example website also has a
page with the theme's shortcodes.

[nonumeros]: https://github.com/nonumeros
[examplesite-pr]: https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress/pull/57

## Configuration
Hugo-Octopress can be configured by modifying the parameters in the
[configuration file](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/). A working
config file `sample-config.toml` is provided. Some miscellaneous parameters are
explained below:

``` toml
baseurl = "http://example.com"
disablePathToLower = false
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Site title"
theme = "hugo-octopress"

# Disqus shortcode
# Disable comments for any individual post by adding "comments: false" in its frontmatter
disqusShortname = "Your disqus shortname"

# Number of blog posts in each pagination page
paginate = 6

[permalinks]
# Configures post URLs
post = "/blog/:year-:month-:day-:title/"

[params]

  # If false, all contents of posts will appear on the front page and in pagination
  truncate = true

  # Author's name (appears in meta tags and under posts)
  author = "Author"

  # This text appears in site header under website title
  subtitle = "Subtitle appears under website title"

  # Search engine URL
  searchEngineURL = "https://www.google.com/search"

  # Text of the "Continue Reading" label. Supports markdown and inline HTML.
  # For example, &rarr; == right arrow.
  continueReadingText = "Would you like to know more? &rarr;"

  # Google analytics code - remove if you do not have/want Google Analytics - needs JavaScript
  googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXX-X"

  # Optional piwik tracking
  #[params.analytics.piwik]
  #  URL = "https://stats.example.com"
  #  ID = "42"

  # Switch to true to enable RSS icon link
  rss = true

  # Set to true to use a text label for RSS instead of an icon
  # This is overwritten by the "rss" setting
  textrss = false

  # Website's default description
  description = ""

  # Populate with your search keywords - these will appear in meta tags
  # defaultKeywords = ["keyword1" , "keyword2" , "keyword3" , "keyword4"]

  # Set to true to hide ReadingTime on posts
  disableReadingTime = false

  # Set to true to disable downloading of remote Google fonts
  disableGoogleFonts = false

  # Remove or set to false to use local fonts
  remoteFonts = false

  # Remove or set to false to use FontAwesome CDN, otherwise, the theme uses ForkAwesome local fonts.
  # fontAwesome = false
```

## Code highlight
This theme uses the built-in [Chroma][chroma-link] highlighter with the
`solarized-dark` theme. See all supported styles at
[https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/all.html](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/all.html).
To change the style, change it in the config file like below to one of the
supported styles.

[chroma-link]: https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma

Some options to control code highlighting post version `0.60`.

``` toml
[markup]
  [markup.tableOfContents]
    endLevel = 8
    startLevel = 1
  [markup.highlight]
    style = "solarized-dark"
```

For more configuration options please see
[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#highlight][hugo-configuration-markup]
and [https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/][hugo-syntax-highlighting] in Hugo's
documentation.

[hugo-syntax-highlighting]: https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/
[hugo-configuration-markup]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#highlight

## Goldmark vs. Blackfriday
Prior to version `0.60`, Hugo used Blackfriday. Now it uses Goldmark by default.
See https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#highlight for
information about setting it up.

There are trade-offs. Mainly, the `hrefTargetBlank` Blackfriday extension. It
was set to true to open external links in a new browser tab. Unfortunately,
Goldmark does not have this built-in. To make it happen, we need to use a render
hook. I used the one in Hugo docs at

https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#link-with-title-markdown-example.

This works for markdown links but not linkify or image links. Linkify links are
straight URLs pasted into the document.

So, I keep using Blackfriday like this:

``` toml
[markup]
  defaultMarkdownHandler = "blackfriday"
  [markup.blackFriday]
    hrefTargetBlank = true
```

## CSS override
You can override the built-in CSS and add your own. Put your CSS files in the
`static` directory of your website. While storing them inside the
`themes/Hugo-Octopress/static` directory works, it's not recommended (keep your
website and theme as separated as possible to be able to switch themes easily).
Then modify the `customCSS` parameter. The path should be relative to the
`static` folder. These CSS files will be added through the `header` partial
after the built-in CSS file.

For example, if custom CSS files are `static/css/custom.css` and
`static/css/custom2.css` then `customCSS` will look like this:

``` toml
[params]
  customCSS = ["css/custom.css","css/custom2.css"]
```

## Navigation menu
Links in the navigation menu (everything other than Google search and RSS icon)
can be customized. The navigation menu is generated using the
`layouts/partials/navigation.html` partial.

By default, navigation menu links will open in the same window. You can change
this behavior by setting the `navigationNewWindow` parameter to true. Links to
root ("/") will always open in the same window. Currently, Hugo does not support
adding custom attributes to menus.

Links are sorted according to weight from left to right. For example, a link
with weight of `-10` will appear to the left of links with weights `0` or `10`.
Links can be added to the config file:

``` toml
[[menu.main]]
  Name = "Blog"
  URL = "/"
  weight = -10

[[menu.main]]
  Name = "The other guy from Wham!"
  URL = "https://www.google.com/search?q=andrew+ridgeley"
  weight = -5

[[menu.main]]
  Name = "This theme - add link"
  URL = "https://www.github.com"

[params]
  # If set to true, navigation menu links will open in a new window with the exception of links to root ("/")
  # If this item does not exist or is set to false, then navigation menu links will open in the same window
  navigationNewWindow = true
```

Search engine customization:

``` toml
[params]
  searchEngineURL = "https://www.google.com/search"
```

## Sidebar
The sidebar has four sections, from top to bottom:

* Sidebar header and text (optional).
* Social network icons (optional): Icons and links to Github, Bitbucket, and more.
* Sidebar menu (optional): Links in sidebar.
* Recent posts: Displays last X posts (default is 5).

The sidebar is generated using the partial at `layouts/partials/sidebar.html`.

### Sidebar text
The sidebar text has two parts and both can be configured. Both are passed to
`markdownify` so you can use markdown (e.g. add links or new lines).

* Sidebar header appears first in an `<h1>` tag. It can be configured with
  `sidebarHeader`.
* Sidebar text appears under the header and is in `sidebarText`.

You can add new lines can be added with two spaces at the end of line. New
paragraphs can be added with two an empty line. when adding two new lines,
remember to remove the indentation otherwise the new line will be treated as a
codeblock.

``` toml
sidebarHeader = "Sidebar Header"

sidebarText = """Here's a [link to google](https://www.google.com)

New paragraph

Another paragraph which has two spaces in the end to create a new line using markdown  
New line but not a new paragraph
"""
```
  
If you want to use `</br>` here and not just markdown, you need to enable unsafe
rendering of HTML in Goldmark. You can do this like this.

``` toml
[markup]
  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.renderer]
      unsafe = true
```

Blackfriday renders the `</br>` tags and does not need extra configuration.

### Social network icons
Sidebar social network icons are configured as follows:

``` toml
[params]
  github = "https://github.com/parsiya/"
  bitbucket = "https://bitbucket.org/parsiya/"
  gitlab = "https://gitlab.com/parsiya"
  twitter = "https://twitter.com/cryptogangsta/"
  keybase = "https://keybase.io/parsiya/"
  linkedin = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsiya/"
  stackoverflow = ""
  youtube = ""
  facebook = ""
  instagram = ""
  bitcoin = ""
```

Icon sequence is unfortunately hardcoded. To modify, copy
`your-website/themes/Hugo-Octopress/layouts/partials/sidebar.html` to
`your-website/layouts/partials/sidebar.html` and modify the sequence. Look for
`<li class="sidebar-nav-item">` tags. Add a `</br>` tag to create a new line.

Code to display links (and the idea to use these icons) is from
[Hyde-x][hyde-x-theme].

[hyde-x-theme]: https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x/

Icons are from [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Fork Awesome][fork-awesome]. To
use icons with square dark backgrounds add `-square`. For example,
`<i class="fa fa-twitter-square fa-3x"></i>`. Size can be from 1 to 5 use
`fa-lg` to make them adaptive.

[font-awesome]: https://fontawesome.com/
[fork-awesome]: https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome

### Sidebar menu
This menu can be enabled by setting `sidebarMenuEnabled` to `true`. It has two
sections:

* A header that appears inside the `<h1>` tag on top. It can be set by
  `sidebarMenuHeader`. This part only supports text.
* A series of links. They can be configured similar to navigation menu items by
  using the `[[menu.sidebar]]` tag. Set `sidebarNewWindow` to `true` to open
  these links in a new window

``` toml
[[menu.sidebar]]
  Name = "Google"
  URL = "https://www.google.com"
  weight = 0

[[menu.sidebar]]
  Name = "Hugo"
  URL = "/categories/hugo/"
  weight = 1
```

### Recent posts
Last x posts can be displayed in the sidebar. This number is controlled by
`sidebarRecentLimit`. To hide this section you can remove `sidebarRecentLimit`
from the config file or set it to zero.

## Shortcodes
Creating [shortcodes][hugo-shortcodes] in Hugo is very easy and one of the
reasons I switched to it. I recreated a few plugins from Octopress. They add
captions to code blocks and images. These shortcodes are in
`layouts/shortcodes/`.

For all my Hugo shortcodes see
[https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Shortcodes][my-shortcodes].

[hugo-shortcodes]: https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes
[my-shortcodes]: https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Shortcode

### Code caption
This shortcode adds a caption to codeblocks. The codeblock is wrapped in a
`<figure>` tag and caption is added using `<figcaption>`. It has two parameters,
`title` which is the caption of the code block and `lang` which is the language
that is passed to the Hugo's `highlight` function along with `linenos=true` to
enable line numbers.

Usage and source (parameters are named and not positional):

``` html
{{< codecaption lang="html" title="Code caption shortcode" >}}
<figure class="code">
  <figcaption>
    <span>{{ .Get "title" }}</span>
  </figcaption>
  <div class="codewrapper">
    {{ highlight .Inner (.Get "lang") "linenos=true" }}
  </div>
</figure>
{{< /codecaption >}}
```

And will look like:

![picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress/master/images/codecaption1.png).

If the code inside the tag overflows, a horizontal sidebar will be added to the
table. It took me a while to achieve this as the `highlight` function created
tables that were out of my control. The output from `highlight` is wrapped in
`<div class="codewrapper">` and the scroll bar will be added for the whole
`div`. The following in the CSS file (starting from line 2225) enables this
behavior:

``` css
div.codewrapper {
    overflow-x: auto;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    background-color: #002B36;
}
```

### Image caption
This shortcode adds captions to pictures. Due to the way the original CSS file
was organized, this shortcode does not use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. `Alt`
tag is also set to `title`.

Usage (parameters are named and not positional):

``` go
{{< imgcap title="Sample caption" src="/images/2016/thetheme/1.png" >}}
```

Results in:

``` html
<span class="caption-wrapper">
  <img class="caption" src="/images/2016/thetheme/1.png" title="Sample caption" alt="Sample caption">
  <span class="caption-text">Sample caption</span>
</span>
```

### Table of Contents
This shortcode adds table of contents to the theme. You can use it to add the
toc to anywhere in the page with `{{< toc >}}`.

## Pages
This section discusses the different kind of pages that are supported by the
theme.

### License page
License page address is `baseurl/license/`. Create a markdown file containing
the text for the license page under `content` and set its type to `license` in
frontmatter:

``` yaml
---
title: "License"
type: license
---

License text
```

License page template is: `layouts/license/single.html`.

### Not Found or 404.html
The `404.html` page has two optional parameters and both support markdown:

* `notFoundHeader`: 404 page title
* `notFoundText`: 404 page text

If they are not set in the config file, theme's default page is used
(`layouts/404.html`).

### Taxonomy pages
You can create taxonomy lists (e.g. categories and tags). Set
`generateTaxonomyList = true` to get generate them at `baseURL/tags/` and
`baseURL/categories`. By default items are sorted by count.
`sortTaxonomyAlphabetical = true` changes the sort to alphabetical.

``` toml
[Params]
  generateTaxonomyList = true

  # Alphabetical sort
  # sortTaxonomyAlphabetical = true
```

To revert, remove `sortTaxonomyAlphabetical` or set it to false.

Note: As of Hugo 0.33, `indexes` has been removed. If your taxonomy pages are
not rendered, please update to the latest version of Hugo. Templates are now at:

* `/layouts/category/category.html`
* `/layouts/tag/tag.html`

### Individual pages
Individual pages can be created in two ways:

* Create a new content file in `content/page`.
* Create a page anywhere inside `content` and set the type `page` in frontmatter. E.g. `type: page`.

The template for individual pages is at
`Hugo-Octopress/layouts/page/single.html`. It can be overridden by a file in the
website's `layouts/page/single.html`. For more information see
[Single Page Templates in Hugodocs][hugo-single-page-templates].

[hugo-single-page-templates]: https://gohugo.io/templates/single-page-templates/

## Table of contents
There are three ways to add `Table of Contents (ToC)` to pages.

### toc configuration
With Goldmark, you need to change the defaults for the table of contents
renderer in your site's config. The defaults only render markdown headings level
2 and 3.

``` toml
[markup]
  [markup.tableOfContents]
    endLevel = 8
    startLevel = 1
```

Please see more at
[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#table-of-contents][toc-config].

[toc-config]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#table-of-contents

### Use toc in Frontmatter
This ToC is on top of the page and does not appear in the summary. You customize
the ToC for each page or globally:

1. Add a variable named  `toc` to the frontmatter of the post/page and set it to `true`.

    ``` yaml
    title: "title"
    date: 2016-04-01T20:22:37-04:00
    draft: false
    toc: true
    ```

2. Enable it globally by setting `tableOfContents` under `[Params]` to `true`.

    ``` toml
    [Params]
      tableOfContents = true
    ```

The `toc` variable in the frontmatter has priority. If it is set to `false` the
global setting is ignored for that page.

### Use the toc Shortcode
If you want the table to appear in a different location use the shortcode. For
example, in [the cheatsheet on my website][website-cheatsheet] it appears after
the summary.

```
---
frontmatter
---

summary or whatever.

{{< toc >}}
```

[website-cheatsheet]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiya/parsiya.net/master/content/page/CheatSheet.markdown

### Editor Plugins
There are various editor plugins that create a table of contents in markdown
using markdown links. This approach is self-contained and not reliant on the
theme or the shortcode. There are varioud plugins that do this, I used the VS
Code plugins [Markdown All in One][markdown-vscode-toc].

[markdown-vscode-toc]: https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown#table-of-contents

## Disqus
Hugo supports Disqus. Note Disqus shortname is directly in the config file (and
not under `params`):

``` toml
disqusShortname = "whatever"
```

You can disable comments for individual pages by adding `comments: false` to
the frontmatter.

## Twitter Card
Twitter card support can be enabled in the config file under `Params`:

``` toml
[params]
  # Twitter card config
  # Enable.
  twitterCardEnabled = true
  # Don't include the @.
  # twitterCardSite = 
  twitterCardDomain = "parsiya.net"
  # Don't include the @.
  twitterCardAuthor = "CryptoGangsta"
```

After Twitter card is enabled, you can add summary images to your posts in front
matter with `twitterImage`:

``` yaml
twitterImage: 02-fuzzer-crash.png
```

**Note:** Image URL should be relative to the page, otherwise the final URL will
not be correct. In short, image URL should be part of the page bundle. In this
case, both `index.md` and `02-fuzzer-crash.png` are in the same root directory.
If the image is in a subdirectory of page bundle, it can be added like this:

``` yaml
twitterImage: images/02-fuzzer-crash.png
```

To modify this template, copy
`your-website/themes/Hugo-Octopress/layouts/partials/custom_twitter_card.html`
to `your-website/layouts/partials/custom-twitter-card.html` and make changes.

## Compact Index
The original theme renders each post's summary in the main page. I prefer a more
compact index and have been using it for my own website for quite a while. You
can enable it by adding the following to the config file:

``` toml
[params]
  # Set to true to enable compact index. Set to false or remove to go back to classic view.
  compactIndex = true
```

[![classic index](images/classicindex_tn.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress/master/images/classicindex.png) [![compact index](images/compactindex_tn.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress/master/images/compactindex.png)

## mainSections
Hugo-Octopress supports using the [mainSections][hugo-mainsections] property in
the config file to display different kinds of posts on the main page. If not
defined, `mainSection` will default to the section with the most number of
pages. In a vanilla Hugo-Octopress setup, it will be under `post`. However, you
can add your own in the config file as follows:

```toml
[params]
  mainSections = ["posts", "blogs"]
```

[hugo-mainsections]: https://gohugo.io/functions/where/#mainsections

See the code in `layouts/partials/classic_index.html`:

```html
<div class="blog-index">
  {{ $paginator := where site.RegularPages "Type" "in" site.Params.mainSections | .Paginate }}
  {{ range $paginator.Pages }}
  <article>
  ...
```

## Troubleshooting
Common issues when dealing with the theme.

### Hugo page summary bug
Without a summary divider `<!--more-->`, Hugo uses the first 70 words of the
post. The result is usually not pretty and contains raw HTML. Always use the
summary divider `<!--more-->` in your posts. This does not matter if you
use the compact index because it does not use the summary.

Hugo does not display render style links in the page summary if the link is also
not before the summary divider. You can read more it
[here](https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/markdown-content-renders-as-regular-text-in-summary/1396/12).

Reference style links look like this:

``` markdown
This is a link to [Example][example-link].

More stuff here.

Usually at the end of the markdown file.
[example-link]: https://www.example.com
```

There are two workarounds:

1. Do not use reference style links in summary. Use normal links like `[Example](https://www.example.com)`.
2. Put the reference links before the summary divider.

### Empty Posts Link on Homepage
After rebuilding the blog with Hugo `0.57`, you may see a single `Posts` link in
the classic index. Update to Hugo `0.57.2+` (there is an issue with `0.57.1`)
and it should work.

For more information please see:

* https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/issues/682

This should not be an issue anymore because the theme's minimum version of Hugo
has been bumped.

## Issues/TODO
If you discover any issues/bugs or want new features please use the Github issue
tracker. Please keep in my mind that development has not been my day job for
quite a while and I may be slow in fixing things (don't be surprised if I ask
you about details).

**The css is a mess.** The CSS file is taken directly from the classic Octopress
theme. I found it easier to just modify the templates to generate HTML code
similar to Octopress' output and use the existing CSS file. It's bulky (around
53KBs and 2300 lines) and it probably has code for elements that are never used
(also duplicates).
